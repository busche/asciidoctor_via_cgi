# asciidoctor_via_cgi
cgi script for on-the-fly conversion of asciidoctor scripts

# Links
the script is based on the initial work of http://powerman.name/download/asciidoc/

# Adaptations
. use asciidoctor, instead of asciidoc
. search for files having the .ascii extension, instead of .txt

# TODO
Not scheduled to be implemented in the next 10 years

. Use dynamic asciidoctor options
